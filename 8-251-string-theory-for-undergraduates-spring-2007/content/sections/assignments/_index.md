There will be weekly homework. No late homework will be accepted. Students will be able to drop one homework - the one with the lowest grade - from their record. Some of the assignments refer to problems from the textbook:

Zwiebach, Barton. _A First Course in String Theory_. New York, NY: Cambridge University Press, 2004. ISBN: 9780521831437.
